# Zebra
A decentralized AI-driven coding platform where users contribute to large-scale projects through skill-based task assignments. AI handles task distribution, code integration, optimization, quality assurance, and real-time feedback. 

> [!Note]
> This document will be updated as the project develops.

## ðŸ§© Technologies Used
- **Backend (Server-side logic)**: Go
- **AI Support**: Node.js to connect with OpenAI
- **Frontend (User interface)**: Next.js
- **Database (Data storage)**: Still deciding (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or another option)
- **User Login**: GitHub OAuth
- **Hosting (Where it runs)**: Still deciding (Cloud service or self-hosted)
  
## âš¡ Key Features
- AI helps break down coding tasks and assigns them to users.
- GitHub integration so users can easily contribute.
- A website where users can write and submit code.
- Automatic merging of contributions.
- A community-driven way to build software together.

## ðŸš€ Future Goals
- Improve AI to review and improve submitted code.
- Create a ranking system to reward helpful contributors.
- Support more programming languages and tools.
- Allow integration with popular coding software like VS Code and JetBrains.
